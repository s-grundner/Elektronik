# Direct Memory Access - DMA

DMA, or Direct Memory Access, is a feature that enables peripherals like hard drives or network adapters to transfer data to and from a computer's memory without the direct involvement of the CPU. It works by allowing a DMA controller to take control of the system bus, configuring the data transfer parameters, and facilitating direct communication between the peripheral and memory. This process reduces the burden on the CPU, freeing it up for other tasks and improving overall system performance. DMA is particularly useful for efficient data transfers, large-scale operations, and real-time applications where timely movement of data is critical. It enhances system efficiency by streamlining the data transfer process.
