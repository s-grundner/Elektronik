# Embedded Systems

- An embedded system is a computer system - a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices - that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.
- It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts.
- Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints.

Speed

- An Embedded System needs to be as fast as the physical process it controls
	- High-speed motion control → µs
	- Temperature control in a room → s, min
- Embedded Systems need to be reactive → always react to changes in the physical process
- Embedded Systems can often not be simply shut off (e.g. flying plane)
- Embedded systems are therefore often real-time systems (see unit 4)
