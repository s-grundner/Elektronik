# Digital Analog Converter

A DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) on a microcontroller transforms digital signals into analog voltage or current outputs. This is valuable for applications like audio playback or analog sensor interfacing. The advantages of a DAC include precise control over analog output levels, enabling accurate representation of information and facilitating smooth, continuous signal generation in various applications. The data can also be transferred via DMA and there also different modes, different triggers, ...
