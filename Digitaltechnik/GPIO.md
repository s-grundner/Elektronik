# General Purpose Input / Output

GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output. In a microcontroller, GPIO refers to pins that can be dynamically configured as either input or output. The concept involves using these pins to interact with external devices or circuits. When configured as input, GPIO pins can sense and read external signals, while as output, they can drive signals to control connected devices. GPIO provides flexibility in connecting a microcontroller to various peripherals, sensors, or actuators, making it a versatile feature for interfacing with the external world.
