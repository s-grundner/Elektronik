# Altium Designer - PCB Design Unit 1

## 1.1 Introduction and Important Terminology

Welcome to the Altium Academy Printed Circuit Board design course! Throughout this course, you’ll be introduced to important ideas involved in PCB design, manufacturing, and assembly. You’ll also get some exposure to industry-standard PCB design software, and you’ll have a chance to use this software to build your own PCB. Hopefully, by the end of the course, you’ll have enough knowledge to design some simpler PCBs and to start taking more advanced industry-level circuit board design and manufacturing courses.

PCB design is as much art as it is science. Some of the important concepts in PCB design rely heavily on knowledge from your prior electronics classes. However, PCB design also requires creativity in how you select components, place them on a circuit board, and connect them with copper. There is also the design of the bare board itself, something that forms the foundation of PCB design and manufacturing. One of the main goals of this course is to give you the knowledge needed to start designing PCBs. We’ll look at examples of real boards to explain why certain design decisions are made and to show how professional designers approach their circuit board designs.

Throughout this course, you’ll have a chance to use Altium Designer, a popular PCB design software package that is used by professionals in the electronics industry. Although some of the lessons and demonstrations will be provided using Altium Designer, you should be able to perform the tasks shown in this course using any other PCB design software application. Guides and walkthroughs will be shown using Altium Designer, so students are encouraged to follow along on their own using an Altium student license, or using a different CAD program.

## 1.2 The Role of ECAD Tools

An important aspect of any engineering design course is learning to use CAD software, and PCB design is no different. PCB designers use specialized CAD tools to create the physical layout of a printed circuit board. When we say “physical layout”, we’re referring to the arrangement of components, pads, traces, vias, and any other component or physical element that will be placed on the PCB.

Technically, you could use any CAD program to create a physical layout of a PCB. However, the industry has developed specialized software, called _ECAD software_, that helps automate many of the tasks involved in creating drawings of a physical layout. Altium Designer is one such program, but there are many others that use similar workflows and have similar tool sets for creating PCB layouts.

The files you create in your ECAD software will store all the information needed to understand and manufacture a design. The PCB layout is most important because it is like a picture of the board that will be fabricated and assembled by a PCB manufacturer. However, a PCB layout is not the only document you’ll work on in your CAD tools. It is also important to understand the primary set of files you’ll need for a design. Different ECAD applications use different sets of files to store design information, but there are a few common file types that are used in every design.
