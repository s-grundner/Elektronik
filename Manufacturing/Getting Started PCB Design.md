# Some Basic Terms to Help You Get Started in This Course

There is some important terminology that is used to describe PCBs, and this terminology will be used throughout the course in various locations. All of the important terminology has been compiled into a [course glossary](https://edcamp.us/p/glossary), you should refer to this document periodically as you work through the course. Some of the important terms to help you get started and progress through the rest of this unit are listed here:

|                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Components**                                   | This can refer to anything that can be soldered onto a PCB. Examples include resistors, capacitors, connectors, and integrated circuits. A component is also an object in a CAD program, and it may refer to a physical feature that is not soldered onto the board.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Printed circuit board (PCB or circuit board)** | Refers to the bare board design without any of the assembled components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **PCB layout**                                   | A CAD drawing showing the location of all elements that will appear on an assembled PCB. This includes all components and copper that will appear on both sides of a PCB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Trace**                                        | A copper connection made between two components in a PCB layout. A trace is sometimes called a “track”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Layers**                                       | All PCBs can have multiple layers, which will include copper connections and components. Internal layers only contain copper, which are only used to make electrical connections. There are two types of layers in any PCB: plane layers and signal layers. A plane layer has a large, uninterrupted copper region that covers the entire layer. A signal layer only contains copper traces that connect the PCB components. |
| **Multilayer PCB**                               | This term refers to any circuit board that has more than two copper layers in total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **PCB stackup**                                  | Also called a layer stack, this term refers to the arrangement of layers used to build a bare printed circuit board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Schematic sheets**                             | Drawings that show how components are connected to each other, similar to a circuit diagram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **PCB fabrication**                              | Refers to the first half of the manufacturing process, where each layer of a bare PCB is fabricated and copper features are etched on the PCB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **PCB assembly (PCBA):**                         | This term has two meanings. It is often used as a noun, referring to a fully assembled PCB. It also refers to the PCB assembly process, where components are soldered onto a bare PCB. In this course, we will normally write “PCBA” for the former, and “PCB assembly” for the latter.                                                                                                                                      |
| **PCB laminate:**                                | Also simply called a laminate, this refers to the insulating material used to separate copper layers and build a PCB stackup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Like many industries, the electronics industry has developed its own terminology, and you will be exposed to many important terms used by design professionals throughout this course. As the course progresses, new terminology will be introduced as it’s needed, but these terms will come up repeatedly to refer to some of the important physical and electrical aspects of all PCBs.

In the next section, we’ll see how CAD tools are used to create PCBs. These software packages are highly specialized for use in creating a PCB layout and manufacturing files, and using CAD tools will be a major focus in this course.
