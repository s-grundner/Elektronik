# PCB Design Software

At the center of PCB design is the use of specialized electronics CAD (ECAD) software. An entire industry has developed around ECAD tools for PCB design, as well as specialized electrical simulators that are used to evaluate designs before they are manufactured. There is also a host of manufacturing software that is used to prepare a design for fabrication and assembly using automated machinery, called computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software. In this course, we won’t focus so much on using CAM software, although we will look at the steps needed to take a finished design and prepare it for manufacturing.

If you look at printed circuit board design software, the view you see may not be the most intuitive. The view you get in ECAD software does not look very much like an actual circuit board you might pull out of your computer or smartphone. In fact, compared to something like a mechanical design, the circuit board you see in your ECAD software may look very strange.

The image below shows an example of a circuit board layout in Altium Designer. This layout may not clearly resemble a real, assembled PCB you would find in an off-the-shelf product. One goal of this course is to teach you how to navigate one of these CAD drawings and identify various structures within the drawing.

_An example PCB layout in Altium Designer._

While it may not be obvious, this circuit board is actually the motherboard for a small computer, and it is available as a sample project within Altium Designer. In this view, we’re only looking at the features in the top-most layer of the board. This board is actually very complex, comprising multiple layers and components on both sides of the board. We’ll return to this layout periodically to show some examples of common features found in PCBs.
