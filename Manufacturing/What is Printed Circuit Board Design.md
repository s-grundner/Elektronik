# What is Printed Circuit Board Design

If you’ve ever opened up an old laptop or smartphone, then you’ve already seen an example of a printed circuit board (PCB). While PCBs can come in all shapes and sizes, they all have common characteristics that are considered during design. A PCB can be very simple, just involving a few components, or they can be very complex, involving thousands of small components and interconnections. All PCBs should be designed while considering the manufacturing process to ensure that a new product can be produced at scale.

## Why is Printed Circuit Board Design Important?

PCBs represent the intersection between all the major types of electronic equipment. Without PCBs, integrated circuits would not be able to connect to communicate with each other in a low-noise environment. It would not be possible to produce products like computers, televisions, modern automobiles, smart phones, satellites, aircraft, and many other devices in their current form. Printed circuit boards do more than just provide a place to put integrated circuits, they provide a way to create very reliable connections between components that can also be manufactured at very high volume.

To a beginner, a circuit board might be seen as an overblown method for connecting electronic components together. This is understandable when looking at the surface of some circuit boards. However, once you look below the surface and into the interior layers of a circuit board, there is a beautiful complexity that provides the connections needed to make modern electronics work. In the past, electronics could be freely strung together with hanging wires, but the nature of modern integrated circuits continually forces design engineers to keep innovating and find new ways to make their designs work as intended.

If you look around your own home and think about the number of electronic devices you own, it’s important to note that any of these devices could contain at least one circuit board. It’s highly likely that, at any given moment, you’re surrounded by a dozen or more circuit boards. PCBs are truly the backbone of modern electronics.
